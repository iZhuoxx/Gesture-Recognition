# Gesture-Recognition
An IoT-oriented Gesture Recognition Model Based on ResNet and Mediapipe

## Description
This projects developed the ResNet-Mediapipe hybrid model in order to implement gesture control of IoT devices. ResNet-Mediapipe can capture hand position in a variety of situations and recognize gestures in real-time with an accuracy rate of over 98.5% and recognition speed up to 45 fps.

 ## Training
The project contains all the code from data processing, data enhancement, model training, and model testing.
This projcts also create a gesture dataset with more than 5700 pictures, and the training datasets has been uploaded to https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/125664

## Hope you can create a better model!
